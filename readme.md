## Azure Cloud Development

Follow the steps below:

### Login to azure
```
azd auth login
```

### Switch to Aspire project
```
cd WeatherApp.AppHost
```

### generate manifest.json
```
dotnet run --publisher manifest --output-path manifest.json
```

### Required only first time
```
azd init
```

What to answer:
```
-> Use code in the current directory

-> Confirm and continue initializing my app

[X] frontend
[ ] weatherapi

Enter a new environment name: staging-environment
```
When done successfully

```
azd up
```

-> subscription selection
-> location
wait for provision resources in Azure

### to delete the resource
```
azd down
```

### to update existing resources
```
azd config set alpha.infraSynth on
azd infra synth
azd up
```

### Enable a feature that generates bicep
```
azd config set alpha.infraSynth on
```

### Generate infra folder with bicep 
```
azd infra synth
```

I have put all commands in line order to start and stop the solution

Before running the following `start.ps1`, you need to edit it with your azure subscription id.

From PowerShell:

```
.\start.ps1
```

if you need to update the existing resources

```
.\update.ps1
```

When finished testing and playing, then clean up:

```
.\stop.ps1
```

Snapshot of `start.ps1` and `stop.ps1` process
